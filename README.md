Tactile Entertainment's Cookie Cats is a popular smartphone puzzle game. By linking the tiles of the same color, players could clear the board and complete the level. Players will have to accomplish each stage to advance to the next level. There are also singing cats featured in the game.

As players accomplish certain stages, they will have to encounter gates that require them to wait sometime before continuing playing. If they want to play immediately, they must make an in-app purchase.

We'll analyze the results of an A/B test in which Cookie Cats' first gate was relocated from level 30 to level 40. We'll look at how it affects player retention and player journey in particular.
